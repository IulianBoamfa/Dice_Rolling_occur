# Dice_Rolling_occur
This is a program which counts the occurrences of the faces of a dice.

The task:

You are supposed to develop a program that will be generating random numbers based on
the user inputs. Program is supposed to ask user for a number of faces of a dice and a number
of throws .
Program is supposed to generate random numbers between 1 and a number of faces and simulate throws based on
number of throws given by the user. Program is supposed to store the number of occurrences
of each number and calculate percentage of occurrence of each number.
Program has to check if the parameters specified by the user are within given
ranges, which are as follows:
Number of faces – x, where 1 < x < 25
Number of throws – x, where 1 < x < 500
If the parameters given by the user are outside of the range, then program should
print a message informing user about invalid parameters and ask the user for
parameters once again.
